# crop_prediction
This project predicts the optimal crop for a field based on soil metrics (Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium, and pH). Using the provided soil_measures.csv dataset, we build multi-class classification models to recommend suitable crops and analyze the most important features influencing crop prediction.
